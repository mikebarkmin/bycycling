Training and racing in [Rouvy](https://rouvy.com) is great. Especially, if you
ride on an AR route. So you can enjoy the nice scenery of some village in Italy
while pedaling your lungs out. Buts sometimes you just want to get into your
hardcore training mode and just do what is necessary to do. Ride a certain route, keep
track of your numbers and beat your personal best. The beautiful thing of
[Rouvy](https://rouvy.com) is that you can pretty easy import any route you
want. In this article I will show you two options:

## Create a Route based on an Outdoor Activity

This option is great if you have ridden a route in real life and want to use
[Rouvy](https://rouvy.com) to use it for training to use it for training. Maybe
you take part in a race every year and want to train the route.

So you go to your last recorded ride of this route in
[Strava](https://strava.com), click on the three dots on the left-hand side and
select "Export Original". You will then be prompted to download a fit-file.

We now import this fit-file as an activity in [Rouvy](https://rouvy.com). You
can find the page under Training, Activity Import. This will take a while,
depending on your activity.

After the upload is finished you can visit the activity and create a new route
based on it. Nice!

## Create any Route

Sometimes you do not have done an activity on your desired route. Maybe you
train for a certain event or what to compare yourself to others, which live far
away. Maybe you moved and want to ride your home-route again. This is also
possible with [Rouvy](https://rouvy.com)- even though it takes a little more
effort to do so.

First we need a nice GPX file, which contains the route data. Since Strava is
the go-to platform for most cyclist and runners out there and therefore will
likely already have your desired route, we use it to obtain the GPX-file.

For example, we want this nice
[Island-Round](https://www.strava.com/routes/197143?%24android_url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.strava%26hl%3Den&%24deeplink_path=strava%3A%2F%2Froutes%2F197143&%24ios_url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fstrava-running-and-cycling-gps%2Fid426826309%3Fmt%3D8&channel=local&strava_deeplink_url=strava%3A%2F%2Froutes%2F197143&tags=view%20route&_branch_match_id=971118424543972605)
in [Rouvy](https://rouvy.com). First we need to export the GPX file. Therefore,
we click on the "GPX export"-button in the top-right-hand corner of the map.

Then we need to download and install the [Rouvy Route
Editor](https://cdn.rouvy.com/downloads/setup_virtualtraining_editor.exe), which
is only available for Windows. We then start the VirtualTraining Editor - this
is what the shortcut is called - and log in which our Rouvy credentials.
Afterwards we click on "Route Editor" and "Import GPS Data". We do a quick
sanity check by looking at the map, give the route a name and assign a sport.

Then we click on "Save Route", click on "Exit Route Editor" and say "Yes" to
uploading the route. The route location search did not work for me, therefore we
just enter the information manually. We confirm the upload. Now we have to wait
a little for an email, which confirms finished processing of our new route.

Now we can ride the [route](https://my.rouvy.com/virtual-routes/detail/80639).

## Summary

We saw two approaches to import routes, which we want to train on, to
[Rouvy](https://rouvy.com). In both cases we will not see a video, but we see
our icon riding on the map view, feel the real gradients and prepare ourselves for
the real deal.

Did you already import a custom route into [Rouvy](https://rouvy.com)? Feel
free to leave a link to the route in the comments. Maybe we can start a weekly
or monthly challenge with rotating routes.

But the most important thing: Stay healthy and keep on cycling.
