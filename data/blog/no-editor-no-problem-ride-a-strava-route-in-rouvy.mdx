## Unfortunate News

I was very disappointed, when I saw the bad news on Reddit - you can not use the Rouvy Editor anymore. In my previous post about [Ride a Strava Route in Rouvy](/blog/ride-a-strava-route-in-rouvy) I explained how you can use any route on Strava in Rouvy by uploading it via their antique editor. But unfortunately this does not work anymore.

I know that the Editor was not visible anymore on their website, which might haven been an indicator that they will be deprecating it very soon, but my hope was that they would replace it with something newer. I think user-generated content was one of the strong suits of Rouvy, and now it got much more complicated to submit new videos to Rouvy. More on that in another blog post. For now, we will focus on pure route creation.

## Dealing with the Situation

Ok let's take a deep breath and think about a workaround. Rouvy has a feature which I have not used personally, but it is the solution to some of our problems. The manual activity feature. Did you use this feature before? Rouvy allows uploading activities which were recorded on an external device. So you were on a beautiful sunny ride yesterday and want to show not only your Strava followers your impressive statistics, but also your Rouvy followers? No problem you just have to visit the usable [Rouvy website](https://my.rouvy.com). Do not get me started on the redesign - cutting features for a more confusing, but modern UI, is not something I would describe as "the right step forward". So now you click on the plus button in the right-hand corner.

Now you can upload either a `.fit` or a `.tcx` file. Afterwards you can click the magnifying glass icon beside the upload status of your activity.

Once you are on the activity site you can create a new route based on this activity.

And done. But how do we get the `.fit` or `.tcx` file?

## Export an Actitiy from Strava as a fit-File

If you rode the route before, and you have an activity on Strava, you need to navigate to this activity. On the left-hand side you should see three dots. When you click them, a menu will open. Now you need to click the option "Export original". Upload this file to Rouvy, create the route, and you are done.

## Export a Route from Strava as a tcx-File

If you never rode the route before, you need to create the route and Strava by using their [route editor](https://www.strava.com/routes/new). Afterwards you can navigate to [My Routes](https://www.strava.com/athlete/routes) and open the route. Underneath the route name you will find a button "Export TCX" click it, upload this file to Rouvy, create the route, and you are done.

## Summary

Due to legal reason Rouvy discontinued their Editor. In this blog post we explored two alternative options to create new routes on Rouvy. I hope this blog post helps you to train for your specific events on Rouvy and will help you achieve your goals. In my next blog posts I will explain how to upload video footage to Rouvy without the Editor, so stay tuned.
