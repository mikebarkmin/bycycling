The process for uploading user recorded videos to Rouvy got much more complicated, because of the recent shutdown of their editor. In my last [blog post](/blog/no-editor-no-problem-ride-a-strava-route-in-rouvy) is explained a workaround for uploading new routes to Rouvy - unfortunately without videos.

In this blog post I will explain the new process of uploading user generated videos to Rouvy.

## The new Process

You need a camera which also records the GPS position you are currently at. Then you need to set the right recording mode. Rouvy demands "Linear Field of View".

The biggest down-side of the new process is, that you can not upload your recorded bike rides to Rouvy. The videos for the new process need to be recorded at 1.3m above the road surface and with a car.

If you met all requirements and have your video file ready, you need to upload it to a file hosting service. You could for example use [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) or something similar. After the upload to the file hosting service is finished you need a public shareable URL, which you need to send via email to Rouvy [support@rouvy.com](mailto://support@rouvy.com).

## Summary

Steps to follow:

- Place camera 1.3 m above the road
- Turn GPS on
- Use your cars, not your bikes
- Set Recording mode to FOV linear
- Upload to file hosting service
- Send link to [support@rouvy.com](mailto://support@rouvy.com)

I am sure that the new process will decrease the number of uploaded videos to Rouvy, but it will also increase the number of quality videos on Rouvy. Only the future will tell. At the moment I am not sure, if Rouvy can keep up with all submission. If you have submitted a video, please tell us how long it took to be rideable on Rouvy.
