On the first of October, I and many of you got the 2021 Rouvy Career Performance email.

_I started only a month ago, so I reached Rookie Level_

In this email we also got information on the upcoming integration of structured
workouts in the Rouvy AR app. Currently, structured workouts are only available
in the older Rouvy Workouts app. Unfortunately we only got one picture showing
the new workouts interface in Rouvy AR. So we will take a deeper look at the
picture and analyze which features we might.

## Old vs. New

Let's start with a quick comparison between the interface of the screens in
Rouvy AR and in Rouvy Workouts.

In the old app, we have a — let's say — very performance oriented screen. We see
numbers, lines and bars all over the place. But if you knew what you were
looking for, the old workouts screen had it all. All the relevant metrics at the
top including heart rate and power zones, your target power in the bottom-left
and the structured workout in the middle. The structured workout is also
overlaid with a graph of your heart rate, power and cadence. So if you are into
training with numbers, you could not ask for more.

The new app on the other side has a much bigger emphasis on bringing the AR
feeling to you. The center of the screen displays a virtual driver, yourself,
and the road you are driving on. The relevant metrics are display in a much more
modern design. The metrics are split across the bottom of the screen. On the
bottom-left you find your averages, in the middle your current power, cadence
and heart rate and on the bottom-right your times. The structured workout is
scaled down and moved to the button. It seems that only the power is displayed
as an overlay.

## Stand-outs

Two things stood out to me when comparing both screens.

First, the heart rate and power zones are missing. In the old app, they are
displayed at the top of the screen. I think Rouvy could add a number over the
heart rate and power icon in the bottom-middle of the screen.

Second, in the new app there is a bar at the right-side of the screen. I have two
ideas what this bar could be for. It could be showing your average effort.
Meaning, how close you are training to the structured workout. It could also be a
slider, which can be adjusted during a workout. Maybe you feel good and scale
the effort up. Meaning temporarily increasing your FTP.

## Conclusion

I really like the modern style of the new screen and as I discussed above we
also see almost every information we saw in the old app. So it seems to be the
same powerful screen, which shows all the number nerds everything they need, but
in a much nicer dress. But huge questions are unanswered. On which roads do we
work out? Is a road directly tied to a workout? Are the roads, maybe, procedural
generated? We do not know yet, but I am curious to find out.

Did the screenshot match your expectations? Are you worried about the new Rouvy
AR app, or can the release not be soon enough for you? Let me know in the
comments.
