I decided to do a sprint triathlon (400 m swim, 20 km ride and 5 km run)
later this year in September.

Previously I run occasionally and did a spinning class once a week. I
would like to add before the Covid pandemic. The first 3/4 of last year
were very quite in terms of my fitness. But then I decided to buy a
spin bike and get back in shape. Since I need a goal to follow, I also
decided to register for a sprint triathlon. I will try to document the
workouts I have done and how I progress here on this blog. If you want
