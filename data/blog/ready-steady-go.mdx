This is my new blog all about cycling. I order a spin bike to get fit and
thought that I might document some of my experiences in a blog.

Since my brand-new spin bike, a [Horizon GR7](https://shop-horizonfitness.eu/products/gr7-indoor-cycle), is a beautiful black and yellow one, the name of
the blog was found in no time. That I am also choose [Rouvy](https://rouvy.com)
as my workout app of choice, which is also mostly black and yellow, is just the
cherry on the cake.

I am hoping to write regularly, but do not count on that, life happens ;). If you
are interested in specific topics leave a comment and I will see if I can write
something about it.
