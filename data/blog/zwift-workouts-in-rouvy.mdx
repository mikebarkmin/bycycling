For of all I think, that [Rouvy](http://rouvy.com) is a great piece of software,
but it is lacking good structured workouts. This is a huge benefit of other
platforms like [Traineroad](https://www.trainerroad.com/) or
[Zwift](https://zwift.com). Especially the Zwift Academy caught my eye as I was
searching for good workouts, which I could replicate with the [Rouvy Workout
Editor](https://my.rouvy.com/workouts/create). After I have convert the first
Academy Workout V02 Over/Unders I was unmotivated to convert the rest of them. I
took a long time to replicate them by hand and ramps are not supported by Rouvy.

Since I am a programmer by heart, I developed a little tool which assists me
with the task. My [MRC Workout Converter](/tools/mrc-workout-creator) converts
workouts from a simple language to an MRC file, which can be imported into
Rouvy.

The language consists of simple statements, which are compatible which [Whats on
Zwift?](https://whatsonzwift.com). So you can take any workout, which is on
Zwift and convert it to an MRC file and therefore to a Rouvy workout.

Here is an example of a simple interval workout:

```
10min from 40 to 85% FTP
30sec @ 90% FTP
3min @ 55% FTP
10x 10sec 150% FTP,
1min @ 70% FTP
10min from 50 to 35% FTP
```

My tool will create a chart like the bottom one. On top of the right-hand side
you can see a little download button, which you can use to download the MRC
file. You also get additional information like duration, intensity and zone distribution.

Due to legal reasons I will not share the converted Zwift Academy Workouts on my
website or make the Rouvy workouts public, you need to do the extra step and
convert them yourself.

I hope you will enjoy the tool and your cool new workouts :)
